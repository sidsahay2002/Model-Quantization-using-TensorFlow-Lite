Model Qunatization using TensorFlow Lite

The project is aimed at reducing the size and inference time of a deep learning based model using TensorFlow's library, TensorFlow Lite. 

The deep learning model is a Covid-19 ChestXray prediction model made using a small CNN arhictecture. 

Two types of quantization techniques were used in this project:
1. Qunatization Aware Training
2. Post-Training Qunatization
